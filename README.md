# simple-blockchain-cpp
A simple blockchain programmed in C++. A personal project for learning about the blockchain technology.

Forked the basic blockchain from Dev Tech Guy on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VDQeQfh4Hs)

The main() only contains a test transaction, feel free to play around with the code.

Update currently in progress. Added a header file and using a safer data structure for transaction data on the Block class.
